            <h2>Why People Reverse Engineer</h2>
            <p>Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a product to understand its design, functionality, and components. Here are some common reasons why people engage in reverse engineering:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Learning and Education:</strong> Understanding how a product works can provide valuable insights and knowledge, especially for students and professionals looking to expand their skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Compatibility and Interoperability:</strong> Ensuring that new products or software are compatible with existing systems often requires understanding the inner workings of those systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Analysis:</strong> Identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a product to improve its security and protect against potential threats. I personally do it for this reason mostly, whether im looking into the physical structure of a designed chip or looking at the software, as a offensive security researcher im always looking for a way in. I also reverse engineer malware samples to understand their behevior, stop them and sometimes attempt to recreate or implement techniques from a criminals malware into my own for research </li>
                <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Gaining inspiration from existing products to create new and improved versions or entirely new innovations.</li>
                <li><strong>Repair and Maintenance:</strong> Diagnosing issues and finding solutions for fixing or maintaining a product, especially when documentation is not available.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Reduction:</strong> Finding ways to manufacture a product more efficiently or using less expensive materials.</li>
            </ul>
